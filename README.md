# Equation-Solving-Robot

The software used for a robot built using a Lego EV3 robotics kit which allows the user to input a mathematical equation (quadratic, logarithmic, trigonometric, etc) and solves said equation by writing the solution physically.

The software is split into two components, a C++ component which deals with solving the given mathematical equations and a RobotC (C-based language) component responsible for controlling the robot.
